# AdwareZoo
Collects References to Adware Installers for Documentation Purposes

## Welcome to the Jungle
The SavingThrows organization hosts the AdwareDefinitions repo to make
definitions of adware and other unwanted software publicly available for admins
to scrutinize. This transparency is a core value of many open source projects.
We believe, in this case, that this transparency facilitates the ability for
users to determine the validity and safety of implementing file removals based
on these definitions. Otherwise, users must trust the supplier of the definitions.

We propose that you trust no one.

## The Zoo
This repository serves to supplement the AdwareDefinitions repo with examples
of adware found in the wild.

Hosting adware installers is a tricky proposition. Most of these adware
products promote themselves as legitimate services, yet the reality is that
they try to take over a user's machine, browser, or components thereof such
that they behave in unexpected ways, that are difficult to undo (or actively
prevented from being undone), that generate ad-click revenue for the provider
of the product at the expense of the user, and do things that the naive user,
directed by questionable websites or the lure of "free" access to videos or
services, does not reasonably expect. Perhaps they even spell out the complete
list of activities that their products will engage in a terms-of-use document,
included with the installer or on a website.

So arguably, there may be copyright issues for hosting installers directly here.
The maintainers of this organization are not lawyers, nor do they wish to be sued.
The information contained here is just that: information. Freely available
software exposes itself to the ability by the public to scrutinize and report
on that software, except where prohibited by the laws regarding
reverse-engineering in the user's country. The adware definitions here have been
generated entirely by examining the plain-text files included with them, as well
as tracking changes to the filesystem on an installed machine. These actions
are well-within the rights of computer users, and do not constitute
"reverse-engineering".

## Adopt a Pet
Please submit URL's and contextual information like screenshots or descriptions
of how user's found and installed adware products. At this time, no packages or
installers are hosted, but the SavingThrows organizaiton will investigate the
risks of that and update this document based on the results of that inquiry.
